## Contributing :loudspeaker:

This project uses a staging branch strategy, with a production branch named **main** and a staging branch named **dev**. **Any new feature or bug fix must be branched out from the staging branch**, *dev*. New features must be filed as issues prior to branching, as these will be populated in our Kanvan Board.

### Naming Conventions

For simplicity and ease of use, any branch dedicated to a new feature should be named as follows:

`feature/issueNumber-feature-name`

Branches dedicated to bug fixing will follow a similar convention:

`bug/issueNumber-bug-to-fix`
